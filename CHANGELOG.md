# Changelog

All notable changes to **MeshCore Chat for Home Assistant** are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) loosely; entries are most-recent-first.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **Custom channel keys (GitHub issue #1).** The "Custom Key" field in
  the Add Channel dialog now correctly accepts a 32-character hex
  string (16 bytes, AES-128) — matching the MeshCore protocol's
  channel-key size and the meshcore_py SDK's validation. Previously
  the field required 64 hex characters and the backend silently
  truncated the input to the first 16 bytes, which meant users
  pasting a normal MeshCore channel key were blocked at validation,
  and users who padded their key to 64 chars only had its first half
  programmed on the radio. Backward compatibility note: channels
  already configured under the prior UI continue to work as-is on
  the radio; re-entering the same key elsewhere now requires only
  the first 32 hex characters of whatever was originally typed.

- **Unread badge clearing on channel re-entry.** When clicking back into
  a busy channel with unread messages exceeding one viewport, the badge
  no longer disappears prematurely and the viewport now lands at the
  unread divider (not at the conversation tail). The fix landed in two
  layers across two commits: the first removed an active-entity-zero
  heuristic in the badge state, added `overflow-anchor: none` to the
  chat container, and gated mark-read during the post-switch scroll;
  the second simplified those gates by blocking the underlying race —
  lazy-load-older firing on the synthetic scroll event that follows
  Lit's re-render after `_fetchAroundAnchor`, before
  `_doScrollWithRetry` positions the divider. Now mark-read fires
  reliably when the user can see the latest message (small or
  fully-visible-unread conversations) and stays when the tail is
  below viewport (long-history channel re-entry).

- **Unread divider** no longer renders when only outgoing groups follow
  the anchor — fixes a divider-projection inconsistency surfaced during
  multi-entry switching tests.

### Refactored

- **UnreadController architecture (Phases 2-4).** The frontend's unread
  state is now consolidated in a single panel-owned `UnreadController`.
  Phase 2 introduces the controller and migrates the badge data
  subscription. Phase 3 moves the per-conversation read-progress state
  machine into the controller (anchor, grace window, post-switch timer,
  dedup guard). Phase 4 centralizes the "↓ N new" pill label and the
  `cursorAtTail` query.

### CI

- **Validate workflow** now skips on non-canonical repos via a
  `github.repository` guard, eliminating spurious HACS-validation
  failures on the private dev mirror.

### Compatibility

Same Home Assistant version floor as 0.2.0 (HA 2024.12+); same
core integration version floor (meshcore-ha v2.6.0+).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-09

First tagged release. Active development continues; treat this as an early preview, not a stable LTS.

### Security audit complete

A pre-public-release audit landed for this version:

- **Admin gate on 15 destructive WebSocket handlers** (b45cfc8). Non-admin HA users can no longer wipe channel keys, regenerate the companion identity, reconfigure the radio, or issue commands to managed repeaters. See [INSTRUCTIONS.md → Permissions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md#permissions) for the full list.
- **XSS hardening** (58454b8). Mention rendering escapes HTML instead of using `unsafeHTML`; regression test covers the previous attack vector.
- **Identity-dialog hardening** (21e5454). Hex validation on key fields; IMPORT flow requires typed confirmation.

### What's in 0.2.0

- Sidebar chat panel with channels, DMs, contact list, and per-message route popups (hops, SNR, RSSI, exact receive timestamp).
- Persistent message store (default 90-day / 500-msg per conversation, configurable to 1–365 days / 50–5000 msgs).
- Cross-conversation date-range search.
- Unread-count cursor — survives reloads, gates auto-mark-read on user engagement, refreshes on entry switch.
- Devices tab — per-device sensor tiles (SNR, RSSI, airtime, battery), neighbor tables, quick-action buttons, Issue Command, Reboot, Start OTA Update.
- Nodes tab — full network discovery view, filterable by Added / Discovered and by node type, with last-heard sort and stale-record cleanup.
- Settings tab — radio configuration (TX power, frequency, bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate, path-hash mode), rename, location, Key Management.
- Trace dialog with Discover, Select repeaters, and Enter path modes.

### Requirements

- Home Assistant **2024.12** or newer.
- Core [meshcore-ha](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/meshcore-ha) integration **v2.6.0** or newer (released 2026-04-27). 0.2.0 of the chat companion calls the structured query services (`meshcore.get_contacts`, `meshcore.trace`) introduced in 2.6.0.

### Installation

Via HACS — see the [README's Installation section](./README.md#installation). After install, restart HA and add the integration from **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → MeshCore Chat**.

### Known issues

- The **Discover** trace mode (flood path discovery) sometimes silently drops on multi-hop routes. If a Discover trace fails, switch to **Select repeaters** or **Enter path** in the trace dialog to specify the route explicitly.

### Upgrading

First tagged release — no migration. If you've been tracking `main` via HACS, switch HACS to track tagged releases and pin v0.2.0.
