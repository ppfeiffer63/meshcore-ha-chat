"""Per-conversation persistent message store for MeshCore Chat.

Lifted from the upstream `meshcore` coordinator and decoupled — this
class owns its own state and storage, and has no
reference to a coordinator. The companion integration owns one instance
per config entry and stores it under
``hass.data["meshcore_chat"][entry_id]["store"]``.

Adaptations from the upstream version:

1. No coordinator coupling — `_loaded_conversations` and friends are
   instance attributes here, not borrowed from a coordinator.
2. Storage key prefix is ``meshcore_chat.*`` instead of ``meshcore.*``
   (avoids file collisions if a similar feature ever lands in core).
3. Tunables (max-per-conversation, retention days) are read from
   ``ConfigEntry.options`` with constants from ``const.py`` as defaults.
4. The store is agnostic about message *contents* — it accepts whatever
   dict the listeners produce. Missing fields like ``hop_count`` and
   ``snr`` (currently absent on incoming-DM events upstream) are simply
   not present in the stored record. No code change
   needed when those fields start arriving.

    Three backfills:

    1. Enrich rx_log entries with ``path_nodes``/``hop_count`` derived
       from ``path``/``path_len``. The upstream coordinator this companion
       consumes emits the raw fields but not the convenience aliases the
       frontend reads — so existing records show "0 hops" until enriched.

    2. Promote stuck outgoing messages from ``delivery_status="pending"``
       to ``"sent"`` when there's clear evidence the message hit the air
       (``repeater_count > 0`` or non-empty ``rx_log_data``). Pre-fix
       outgoing records all defaulted to "pending" and never advanced
       because progressive delivery_update events also defaulted to
       "pending". This unsticks them on next load.

    3. Synth a single-entry ``rx_log_data`` for DMs that carry top-level
       ``hop_count`` but no ``rx_log_data``. The frontend route popup keys
       off ``rx_log_data``; without this, DMs (which never get RX_LOG
       correlation) wouldn't show route metadata. Mirrors the live-message
       synth in ``__init__.py`` so existing stored DMs benefit too.

          direction.

        Anchor-not-found path: pruning, manual
        deletion of ``.storage/meshcore_chat.<entity>.json``, or a future

        view that's identical to a fresh-install open. The total fallback
        size matches the regular window's max length (75 by default), so
        the panel never has to special-case the wire shape.
