"""Per-channel region-scope persistence for MeshCore Chat.

MeshCore channels live on the companion radio as (index, name, key)
slots — the device-side channel record has no field for a region scope,
and the upstream meshcore integration treats scope as a per-send
argument (the optional ``scope`` on ``meshcore.send_channel_message``,
added by meshcore-dev/meshcore-ha#250) rather than channel state. The
chat panel's per-channel scope selector therefore needs its own durable
home: this module persists the user's chosen scope per
(upstream config entry, channel index) pair via HA's ``Store`` helper.

Writes happen only when the user saves or removes a channel in the
panel, so saves are immediate (no debounce). The singleton instance
lives in the companion's domain bucket:
``hass.data["meshcore_chat"]["channel_scopes"]``.
